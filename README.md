# Solar Forecasting Models

## Introduction
Effective solar energy utilization demands improvements in forecasting due to the unpredictable nature of solar irradiance (SI). This study introduces and rigorously tests two innovative forecasting models across different locations: the Sequential Deep Artificial Neural Network (SDANN) and the Deep Hybrid Random Forest Gradient Boosting (RFGB).

## Background
The anticipated rise in global energy demand necessitates a significant shift towards renewable sources. Solar energy, particularly effective in regions with high solar exposure, is emerging as a crucial renewable contender. Advanced solar forecasting is recognized for its substantial benefits in the renewable energy sector.

## Contributions
This research integrates sophisticated AI and machine learning for SI forecasting, addressing challenges like balancing computational efficiency with accuracy and refining the accuracy and adaptability of our models. Our study explores solar energy potential using innovative deep learning techniques, focusing on the SDANN and Hybrid RFGB models.

## Methodology
### Data Sites
We selected the cities of Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Turbat in Pakistan for their advantageous meteorological conditions for solar energy potential forecasting.

### Data Collection
The dataset was sourced from NASA's Langley Research Center's POWER Project, providing a comprehensive foundation for our analysis.

### Model Architecture
Our models leverage advanced AI techniques to forecast solar irradiance, utilizing a deep learning approach with SDANN and a hybrid method combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting in RFGB.

## Findings
Our research not only advances the field of SI forecasting but also conducts detailed ablation studies to assess meteorological feature impacts on model performance.

## Conclusion
By integrating cutting-edge AI in SI forecasting, this research not only advances the field but also sets the stage for future renewable energy strategies and global policy-making.
